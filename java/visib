Hidden Dependencies:

Airflow UI shows DAGs as independent
Actual workflow dependencies are managed externally
No visual representation of cross-DAG relationships
Makes debugging and monitoring difficult


Failure Propagation:

File processing issues in DAG 1 aren't properly communicated
DAG 2 can start even if DAG 1 fails
No built-in failure handling between DAGs
Data consistency issues can occur


Monitoring Challenges:

Can't track end-to-end workflow status
Missing dependency information in logs
Difficult to implement retry mechanisms
Complex error recovery

==========================================

1. Lack of Visibility in Workflow Dependencies
Problem: Push-based triggers bypass Airflow's DAG dependency graph, making it hard to visualize the entire workflow.
Use Case: A DAG processes a file from S3 and then triggers another DAG for database updates. If the file is missing or incomplete, the second DAG might still execute incorrectly because the dependency is managed externally.


Increased Debugging Complexity
Problem: Debugging becomes harder because dependencies are not defined within Airflow but distributed across external systems.
Use Case: A failure in a downstream task due to missing upstream data requires checking multiple systems (e.g., Kafka, APIs, and Airflow logs), increasing the time to resolve issues.


Inconsistent State Tracking
Problem: Airflow's task and DAG state tracking is bypassed in a push-based model, leading to potential inconsistencies.
Scenario: An event triggers a DAG while another run is still in progress. Without state management, overlapping DAG runs may lead to resource contention or inconsistent outputs.
