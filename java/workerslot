Slide 1: Problem Statement
Current Situation:
Traditional Airflow sensors (e.g., FileSensor, ExternalTaskSensor) continuously check for conditions (e.g., file arrival, external task completion).
Key Issue:
These sensors occupy a worker slot while waiting.
Workers are expensive infrastructure components, and "holding" a slot for an indefinite period leads to inefficiency and increased costs.
Impact:
If many sensors are running concurrently, a large portion of workers' capacity is tied up doing nothing but waiting. This inflates infrastructure costs and reduces the throughput of actual data processing tasks.
