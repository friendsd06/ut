Here's an expanded draft message incorporating the push model question:
"Hi,
I hope this finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding Apache Airflow's trigger features, as our team is evaluating their implementation. We have a few specific questions:

Could you share insights on the practical benefits of using Airflow triggers compared to traditional scheduling? We're particularly interested in understanding how they can improve our workflow efficiency.
We're specifically interested in implementing a push model where DAGs are triggered by external events. Could you share:

Best practices for implementing event-driven triggers
Any limitations or potential bottlenecks we should be aware of
How to handle error scenarios in push-based triggers
Security considerations for external trigger endpoints


What's your experience with the cost implications of using triggers? We're looking to understand:

Infrastructure costs for maintaining trigger endpoints
Resource utilization compared to scheduled runs
Any hidden costs we should factor in
Cost optimization strategies


As newcomers to this feature, what are the key considerations or potential challenges we should be aware of during implementation?
Do you have any recommendations for monitoring and observability when using external triggers to ensure reliability?

Your insights would be extremely helpful for our evaluation process.
Thank you for your time.
Best regards,
[Your name]"
Would you like me to adjust any points or add more specific technical details?
