Let's break down the key differences:

Traditional Sensor Operation:

pythonCopy# Without deferrable=True
file_sensor = FileSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_file',
    filepath='/path/to/file.csv',
    poke_interval=60
)

Takes one worker slot per sensor
Runs a dedicated Python process
Continuously polls (busy waiting)
Blocks the worker slot until condition is met


Deferrable Sensor Operation:

pythonCopy# With deferrable=True
file_sensor = FileSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_file',
    filepath='/path/to/file.csv',
    deferrable=True
)

Uses the triggerer process instead of worker slots
Uses async/await pattern
Event-driven architecture
Single process handles multiple sensors efficiently

Resource Usage Comparison:
CopyTraditional (100 Sensors):
- 100 worker slots
- 100 Python processes
- High CPU usage due to polling
- High memory usage

Deferrable (100 Sensors):
- 0 worker slots
- 1 triggerer process
- Low CPU usage (event-driven)
- Low memory usage
Why It's More Efficient:
pythonCopy# Traditional approach (simplified)
def traditional_sensor():
    while True:
        check_condition()  # Blocks worker slot
        sleep(60)         # Still blocks slot while sleeping

# Deferrable approach (simplified)
async def deferrable_sensor():
    while True:
        await check_condition()  # Releases control during wait
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Non-blocking sleep
The triggerer process DOES use CPU, but efficiently:

Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
Single process handles multiple sensors
Event-driven instead of continuous polling
Releases CPU when waiting for events

Example Monitoring:
pythonCopydef check_resource_usage():
    from airflow.jobs.triggerer import TriggererJob

    triggerer = TriggererJob.most_recent_job()
    if triggerer:
        print(f"Active triggers: {len(triggerer.triggers)}")
        print(f"CPU Usage: {triggerer.cpu_usage}%")
        print(f"Memory Usage: {triggerer.memory_usage}MB")
Key Benefits:

Frees up worker slots for actual task execution
More efficient resource utilization
Better scalability
Lower operational costs

Would you like me to:

Show more detailed resource monitoring examples?
Explain the async/await pattern in more detail?
Provide best practices for optimizing triggerer performance?

Banking Event Processing System ArchitectureClick to open diagram
This banking version shows:

Event Processing Structure:


Main Event Loop: Orchestrates all banking transaction processing
Trigger Pool: Handles different types of financial transactions
Message Processing Pool: Processes banking operations asynchronously


Specific Triggers:


Deposits Trigger: Monitors incoming deposit transactions
Withdrawals Trigger: Handles withdrawal requests
Investments Trigger: Manages investment operations


Message Processors:


Concurrent processing of banking transactions
Non-blocking operations for better throughput
Handles multiple financial operations simultaneously


AWS SQS Queues:


Separate queues for deposits, withdrawals, and investments
Ensures isolation of different transaction types
Provides message persistence and reliability

This architecture enables:

High-throughput transaction processing
Isolation between different banking operations
Scalable handling of financial transactions
Reliable message processing with error handling
