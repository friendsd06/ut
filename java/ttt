Conclusion:

If your main goal is absolute cost efficiency and you have a robust external event infrastructure, push-based triggering is likely the cheapest, as Airflow does not wait at all.
If you want easier debugging, visibility, and centralized orchestration while still maintaining low cost and high scalability, using the Triggerer with deferrable operators is an excellent balance.




Aspect	Triggerer (Deferrable Operators)	Push-Based (External Event)
Cost at Scale (100 Concurrent Tasks)	Low (Compared to Traditional Polling): No blocked workers, minimal overhead. A single Triggerer handles thousands of waits efficiently. Some minimal cost for the Triggerer process itself, but no continuous polling by workers.	Potentially Lowest: No waiting tasks in Airflow at all. DAGs run only when triggered, eliminating waiting costs entirely. No Triggerer overhead since Airflow does not wait internally.
Debugging Complexity	Simpler Debugging: All dependencies and waits managed inside Airflow. One UI to view task states and waiting conditions, making troubleshooting straightforward.	More Complex Debugging: Must check external systems for event sources, delivery issues, and triggering logic. Airflow only sees that a DAG run started, not why. Requires additional monitoring outside Airflow.
Visibility	High Visibility: All task states, dependencies, and wait conditions visible in the Airflow UI. Centralized orchestration provides a single pane of glass.	Reduced Visibility: Airflow sees only triggered runs. Understanding why a DAG started or didn’t may require checking external event logs or dashboards outside Airflow.
Scalability	Excellent: One Triggerer can handle thousands of deferrable tasks concurrently. Scales well within Airflow’s architecture.	Also Excellent: No waiting tasks means scaling Airflow is simpler. Airflow only needs resources when tasks actually run. Scalability depends more on the external event system’s capacity.
Maintenance	Centralized Maintenance: All logic and waiting conditions are defined in Airflow’s DAGs. Easier to maintain a single orchestrator.	Distributed Maintenance: Additional complexity in setting up and maintaining external triggers, ensuring reliable event delivery, and possibly integrating multiple external systems.
Flexibility	Good: Changing conditions or adding dependencies can be done in DAG code. Airflow manages all logic internally.	Flexible if Already Event-Driven: Works best if the organization is already using event streams or webhooks. Changes to triggering logic may require updates to external systems.
Cost During Idle Times	Minimal: The Triggerer is lightweight. Even with many deferrable tasks, cost remains low as no workers are waiting idly.	Zero: If no events trigger DAGs, Airflow is idle. No cost for waiting or monitoring since there’s no internal waiting at all.
Latency for Starting Tasks	Slight Delay: The Triggerer checks events asynchronously. Still efficient, but there may be a brief waiting period before tasks resume.	Potentially Immediate: As soon as the external event occurs, the DAG is triggered, resulting in near-instant task starts (assuming quick API calls).
