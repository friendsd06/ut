Conclusion:

If your main goal is absolute cost efficiency and you have a robust external event infrastructure, push-based triggering is likely the cheapest, as Airflow does not wait at all.
If you want easier debugging, visibility, and centralized orchestration while still maintaining low cost and high scalability, using the Triggerer with deferrable operators is an excellent balance.
