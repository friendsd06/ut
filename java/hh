Using DAG Factory to Create DAGs
What is DAG Factory?
DAG Factory is an open-source library that simplifies the creation of Airflow DAGs by using YAML-based configuration files. Instead of writing Python code for each DAG, you define your DAGs’ tasks, dependencies, and parameters in YAML, and DAG Factory generates the Python DAG files at runtime.

Advantages of DAG Factory
Rapid Development Through Configuration-Driven Approach

Reasoning: With DAG Factory, you can define the structure and parameters of a DAG in a YAML file rather than writing Python code directly. This reduces code duplication and speeds up DAG creation.
Example: Suppose you have a standard Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pattern repeated across multiple data sources. Instead of writing a Python DAG file for each source, you could write a single YAML template and change parameters like the source database name, S3 bucket, or schema. This reduces boilerplate code.
Consistency and Standardization

Reasoning: YAML configuration files enforce a standardized format. This makes it easier for teams to follow agreed-upon DAG conventions without needing each engineer to know intricate Python details.
Example: A team new to Airflow can simply follow a template YAML structure to create new DAGs. This ensures uniform naming conventions, consistent retry policies, and standardized SLAs across all DAGs.
Low Barrier to Entry for Non-Python Users

Reasoning: Some data engineers or analysts may not be comfortable writing detailed Python code. A YAML-driven approach lowers the technical entry barrier.
Example: A data analyst who knows YAML but not Python can still author a DAG that runs a SQL script on a schedule, without needing deep knowledge of the Airflow Python DAG API.
Clear Separation of Configuration and Logic

Reasoning: The logic for generating DAGs (DAG Factory’s code) is separated from the configuration (the YAML files), promoting cleaner code organization.
Example: All credentials, parameters, and schedules are in YAML. The code for rendering and generating Python DAGs is in the DAG Factory library. This separation makes maintenance and troubleshooting simpler.
Disadvantages of DAG Factory
Limited Flexibility and Customization

Reasoning: While YAML configuration is convenient, it can be restrictive. For complex or non-standard DAG structures, you might struggle to express your logic purely through configuration.
Example: If you need a DAG that dynamically generates tasks based on a database query performed at DAG generation time, YAML might not suffice. You may be forced into complex templating or custom Python code that defeats the simplicity that DAG Factory aims to provide.
Dependency on an External Tool

Reasoning: DAG Factory is an additional layer on top of Airflow. Any issues, bugs, or updates in DAG Factory might affect your DAG generation. Relying on a third-party tool introduces a dependency that you must manage and maintain.
Example: A new Airflow version might cause DAG Factory to break. You might need to wait for an update to DAG Factory or troubleshoot compatibility issues yourself, slowing down development cycles.
Less Fine-Grained Control Over Code-Level Optimizations

Reasoning: While YAML is good for configuration, certain code-level optimizations (caching results, adding custom hooks or operators, applying conditional logic) are trickier. The abstraction layer may force you into predefined patterns.
Example: Implementing a custom Python Operator that checks system load before scheduling tasks might be convoluted. With a fully code-based DAG, you can directly import and incorporate custom logic. With DAG Factory, you need to figure out how to integrate it via YAML or plugin architecture, which can be unwieldy.
Learning Curve for Complex Dynamic Requirements

Reasoning: Although DAG Factory is easy for simple cases, for advanced dynamic DAG requirements (e.g., runtime parameterization based on database lookups, complex branching logic), you might spend more time learning how to work around the YAML structure than if you just wrote Python code directly.
Example: Suppose you need to read from a metadata database at DAG generation time, pivot the data, and then create a variable number of tasks. Achieving this with YAML might require significant overhead or even custom pre-processing scripts.
Building Your Own Framework with a Metadata DB and Jinja Templates
What does this approach entail?
In this custom scenario, you maintain all DAG metadata (e.g., task definitions, parameters, schedules, dependencies) in a relational or NoSQL database. At DAG generation time, you query this database, and then use Jinja or other templating engines to programmatically construct Python DAG code. This gives you ultimate flexibility and control.

Advantages of a Custom Framework
High Degree of Flexibility and Control

Reasoning: Because you own the framework, you can implement any logic you desire. You’re not constrained by a configuration schema imposed by a tool like DAG Factory.
Example: If you need to dynamically create tasks based on the result of a complex SQL query (e.g., generating a DAG with one task per active client found in the clients table), you can just run that query and loop over the results in Python to generate tasks.
Tailored to Your Organization’s Needs

Reasoning: You can incorporate custom business logic, logging, error handling, and integration with internal systems directly into your DAG generation code.
Example: If your company has a proprietary data catalog or custom service discovery mechanism, you can integrate it natively. Your DAG generation code can query that service and build DAGs accordingly.
Jinja Templates for Readable Code Generation

Reasoning: Using Jinja templates, you still separate logic from presentation. The base DAG code can be a template, and you fill in details dynamically. This keeps code generation cleaner and more maintainable.
Example: A Jinja template might define a generic ETL DAG structure, with placeholders for task IDs, parameters, and schedules. Your Python script queries the DB, and for each configuration record, renders the template to produce a final DAG Python file.
Direct Integration with Metadata Databases

Reasoning: Storing DAG definitions in a database makes it easier to apply versioning, auditing, and centralized governance. You can easily update a parameter in the DB and have all affected DAGs update in the next generation cycle.
Example: If the start times of all ETL jobs need to be shifted by an hour, you just update a column in the database. Your DAG generation script, next time it runs, will incorporate the new schedules without touching code.
Scaling to Complex Dynamic Use Cases

Reasoning: For very dynamic DAGs that depend on external states, APIs, or intricate logic, raw Python code plus a templating system is more expressive than YAML. You’re not limited by a configuration schema and can implement any logic you need.
Example: Creating DAGs that differ drastically in structure (not just parameter differences) is simpler. You can code conditional branches in Python that choose different templates or logic paths depending on the metadata retrieved.
Disadvantages of a Custom Framework
Higher Initial Development Effort

Reasoning: You must build and maintain the framework yourself. This includes writing code to:
Connect to and query the metadata database
Render templates
Ensure the generated code is valid Python and valid Airflow DAG code
Example: Before you get the first DAG running, you might spend weeks creating a stable system for metadata-driven DAG generation, including error handling, logging, validation, and testing.
Maintenance and Long-Term Ownership Costs

Reasoning: Since it’s a custom solution, your team bears full responsibility for updates, bug fixes, and compatibility with new Airflow versions. There’s no external community or maintainers to rely on.
Example: When Airflow 3.0 introduces breaking changes in DAG definitions, you must refactor your entire framework. With DAG Factory, you might rely on community support or documentation. With a custom solution, you’re on your own.
Steeper Learning Curve for New Team Members

Reasoning: New hires must learn the idiosyncrasies of your custom framework. While DAG Factory has documentation and community support, your internal tool does not.
Example: A new data engineer joining the team must first understand the custom metadata schema, the templating logic, and the code generation pipeline before they can confidently create or modify DAGs.
Testing and Validation Complexity

Reasoning: With a custom framework, you must develop robust testing strategies to ensure that generated DAGs are correct and production-safe. There are no built-in validation tools from a library like DAG Factory.
Example: You might need to write unit tests for the code that queries the metadata DB, integration tests that run template rendering, and end-to-end tests that verify the resulting DAGs work as expected in Airflow’s environment.
Use Cases Comparison
Use Case 1: Simple, Repetitive DAGs with Minor Variations

DAG Factory: Perfectly suitable. Just create a YAML template and vary parameters per DAG. Low overhead, quick to implement.
Custom Framework: Overkill for simple repetitive DAGs. You’ll spend more time building infrastructure than necessary.
Use Case 2: Highly Dynamic DAGs Based on External Metadata

DAG Factory: Challenging. YAML is static, and supporting complex logic or dynamic task generation might require awkward workarounds.
Custom Framework: Ideal. Query the metadata DB at runtime, use Python logic to generate DAG tasks dynamically, and Jinja templates for final rendering.
Use Case 3: Organization-Wide Standardization with Limited Python Expertise

DAG Factory: Good choice. Non-developers can contribute by editing YAML files. Consistency is enforced by the YAML schema.
Custom Framework: More difficult. Non-technical users must learn your custom system’s specifics. Additional tooling or documentation is required.
Use Case 4: Proprietary Integrations and Complex Custom Logic

DAG Factory: Restrictive. You may have to patch or extend DAG Factory or break out into Python anyway.
Custom Framework: Excellent. Your Python code can integrate with any internal APIs, handle custom logic gracefully, and evolve as your needs grow.
Conclusion
DAG Factory suits environments where:

DAGs are mostly similar and differ primarily in parameters.
The team values simplicity, standardization, and a low-code approach.
The organization prefers maintaining a lightweight configuration-based system rather than a complex custom code base.
A Custom Metadata-Driven Framework with Jinja Templates is ideal where:

Extreme flexibility is required.
You want to dynamically construct very complex DAGs on the fly.
The team has enough Python expertise and capacity to maintain a custom framework.
Integration with internal systems or complex logic is a priority.
In essence, DAG Factory trades off some flexibility for ease of use and standardization, while a custom framework offers complete control at the cost of higher development and maintenance burden.

Use Case 2: Highly Dynamic DAGs Based on External Metadata

DAG Factory: Challenging. YAML is static, and supporting complex logic or dynamic task generation might require awkward workarounds. take complex example and prove it
ChatGPT

Thought about dynamic DAG generation challenges for 4 seconds
Below is a detailed, concrete example that illustrates the difficulties of using DAG Factory when faced with highly dynamic DAG creation needs based on external metadata. We’ll take a complex scenario and walk through the challenges step-by-step.

Scenario
Business Use Case:
Your company maintains a daily-updated database table called clients that lists all active clients for a given day. Each client has associated parameters (e.g., client_id, data source credentials, and a set of transformations they need). The company wants to generate a single Airflow DAG every day that dynamically creates one ETL task per active client to ingest, transform, and load data specific to that client. The number of clients changes daily—some clients churn, new clients are added, and others become inactive.

Key Requirement:

Each day, when the Airflow scheduler parses the DAG, it should read the current list of clients from an external database and create a series of tasks—one for each client.
The DAG tasks might need to adapt to different parameters depending on each client’s configuration (e.g., using different AWS S3 buckets, different SQL queries, or different transformation logic).
How DAG Factory Works
DAG Factory Basics:

You define DAGs through YAML configuration files.
The YAML typically includes:
A fixed set of tasks.
Predetermined parameters.
Static schedules.
Static Nature of YAML:

The YAML file is parsed at Airflow startup or whenever DAGs are refreshed.
To incorporate dynamic elements, you must predetermine them before the DAG is parsed.
YAML is generally static; it doesn’t inherently support complex runtime logic like querying a database at DAG parse time to vary the number of tasks.
Attempting the Use Case with DAG Factory
Naive Approach:

One YAML file per client:

You might try creating one YAML file per client. Each YAML describes a DAG or a set of tasks for that client.
Problem: The number of clients changes daily. You’d need a mechanism to generate or remove these YAML files every day. This introduces a secondary process that must run before Airflow parses DAGs, updating YAML files dynamically. This secondary step is cumbersome and error-prone.
Single YAML file for all clients:

You might try to have one YAML file that includes tasks for all clients.
Problem: You don’t know how many clients there will be on a given day. You could try to parameterize this in YAML, but YAML is not inherently dynamic. It cannot execute a query at parse time to determine the number of tasks needed.
Workarounds with DAG Factory:

Pre-Generation Script:
You could write a Python script that runs before the Airflow DAG parsing process. This script:

Queries the database to fetch the current list of clients.
Dynamically generates or updates a YAML configuration that includes one task per client.
Challenge:
After this script updates the YAML file, you must somehow trigger Airflow’s DAG parsing. Airflow needs to re-scan the DAG directory to pick up changes. This means you’re adding complexity:

A cron job or external trigger that updates YAML files.
Coupling two steps: first update YAML, then let Airflow parse.
This reduces the simplicity that DAG Factory aims to provide. Instead of defining configuration once, you have a whole chain of processes to maintain.
Templating Within YAML:
DAG Factory supports Jinja templating in YAML to some extent. You could try something like this:

yaml
Copy code
default_args:
  owner: "airflow"
  start_date: "{{ ds }}"

tasks:
  - task_id: "extract_{{ params.client_id }}"
    operator: "BashOperator"
    bash_command: "python extract.py --client_id={{ params.client_id }}"

  - task_id: "transform_{{ params.client_id }}"
    operator: "BashOperator"
    bash_command: "python transform.py --client_id={{ params.client_id }}"

  - task_id: "load_{{ params.client_id }}"
    operator: "BashOperator"
    bash_command: "python load.py --client_id={{ params.client_id }}"
Problem:

This YAML still describes a fixed set of tasks. It doesn’t define how to loop over a dynamically fetched list of clients. Jinja templates in YAML typically help with parameter substitution, not dynamically creating a variable number of tasks.
Even if you tried to use Jinja to loop within YAML (assuming you have a custom pre-processing step), you still need a mechanism to feed it the dynamic list of clients. That list must come from somewhere at DAG parse time. Airflow's DAG parsing typically doesn't natively provide a convenient hook for YAML-based frameworks to fetch external metadata at this stage.

               bash_command: "python load.py --client_id={{ params.client_id }}"
           Problem:

           This YAML still describes a fixed set of tasks. It doesn’t define how to loop over a dynamically fetched list of clients. Jinja templates in YAML typically help with parameter substitution, not dynamically creating a variable number of tasks.
           Even if you tried to use Jinja to loop within YAML (assuming you have a custom pre-processing step), you still need a mechanism to feed it the dynamic list of clients. That list must come from somewhere at DAG parse time. Airflow's DAG parsing typically doesn't natively provide a convenient hook for YAML-based frameworks to fetch external metadata at this stage.
           Complex Example to Highlight the Issue:

           Suppose you have logic like this:

           "For each client in the clients table, if client.is_active == True and client.last_run_successful == False, create a sequence of tasks: extract_client_data, transform_client_data, load_client_data. The tasks differ slightly per client. Some clients use transform_script_A.py, others use transform_script_B.py. Moreover, the number of transformations per client is itself dynamic, based on a transform_config column in the database."

           With DAG Factory's YAML:

           You have a static YAML file.
           To implement dynamic logic:
           You would need to somehow fetch the clients table and run conditional logic to pick the transform script at parse time.
           YAML alone doesn’t have logic to conditionally add tasks based on database values. You must rely on a pre-processing layer that runs outside of Airflow, creating a final YAML that’s fully expanded.
           After the preprocessing, your YAML might have something like:

           yaml
           Copy code
           # Generated by a pre-processing script
           tasks:
             - task_id: "extract_client_101"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python extract.py --client_id=101"
             - task_id: "transform_client_101"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python transform_script_B.py --client_id=101"
             - task_id: "load_client_101"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python load.py --client_id=101"

             - task_id: "extract_client_202"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python extract.py --client_id=202"
             - task_id: "transform_client_202"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python transform_script_A.py --client_id=202"
             - task_id: "load_client_202"
               operator: "BashOperator"
               bash_command: "python load.py --client_id=202"
 have logic like this:

"For each client in the clients table, if client.is_active == True and client.last_run_successful == False, create a sequence of tasks: extract_client_data, transform_client_data, load_client_data. The tasks differ slightly per client. Some clients use transform_script_A.py, others use transform_script_B.py.
