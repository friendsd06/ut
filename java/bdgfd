Truth about Triggerer Resource Usage:

System Resources Used:

pythonCopy# Even with deferrable=True, system resources are used
triggerer_resources = {
    "CPU": "Used for event loop processing",
    "Memory": "State management and queues",
    "IO": "Network and file operations",
    "System_Threads": "Async operation handling"
}

Difference from Worker Slots:

pythonCopy# Traditional Worker Slot
worker_slot = {
    "Dedicated_Process": True,
    "Resource_Blocking": True,
    "CPU_Usage": "High",
    "Memory_Usage": "High"
}

# Triggerer Process
triggerer = {
    "Dedicated_Process": False,
    "Resource_Blocking": False,
    "CPU_Usage": "Low to Medium",
    "Memory_Usage": "Moderate"
}

Real Resource Impact:

pythonCopy# Resource consumption for 100 sensors
traditional_approach = {
    "worker_slots": 100,
    "cpu_per_slot": "~5-10%",
    "total_cpu": "500-1000%"  # Can exceed 100% due to multiple cores
}

triggerer_approach = {
    "worker_slots": 0,
    "cpu_usage": "~20-30%",  # Single process
    "total_cpu": "20-30%"    # Much more efficient
}
Key Points:

CPU is still used:

Event loop processing
Message handling
Task state management


Memory is still used:

State tracking
Message queues
Connection pools


Main Differences:

More efficient resource sharing
No blocking of worker slots
Lower overall system impact
Better resource utilization



Remember:

While it doesn't use Airflow worker slots, it does use system resources
The resource usage is more efficient than traditional worker slots
Monitoring system resources is still important
Proper sizing of triggerer processes is needed based on load
