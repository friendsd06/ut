Which responsibilities can be moved out of NRValidationServiceImpl (e.g., duplicate detection, query construction)?
Do we want distinct strategies for single- vs multi-column validation (ValidationStrategy pattern)?



Functional requirements	What exact behaviours must stay identical?
Are there undocumented edge-cases (e.g., empty request list, null columns, non-ASCII codes) we must still support?
Does the AMU early-exit rule ever change per product line?
API & contracts	Can the method signature change (return a richer object, throw fewer exceptions)?
Should error messages be internationalised or made more user-friendly?
Domain modelling	Is “position-code” really one concept, or should multi-column codes become their own value-object class?
Would introducing an enum for frequency (DAILY, MONTHLY) make the code clearer?
Separation of concerns	Which responsibilities can be moved out of NRValidationServiceImpl (e.g., duplicate detection, query construction)?
Do we want distinct strategies for single- vs multi-column validation (ValidationStrategy pattern)?
Error handling	Do we still need two custom exceptions (NewRecordException, StorageServiceConnectionException) or can we unify them?
Should we convert any runtime exceptions into ResponseStatusException earlier in the stack?
Performance / scalability	Is validation ever on the hot path for bulk imports—do we need batch queries instead of row-by-row calls?
Could cache-warming the valid-code set at startup remove the need for per-request DB hits?
