Subject: New Tool for FMTT Project - Universal Log Viewer Saves Hours of Manual Analysis

Hi Team,

I have built a new tool for FMTT project that will significantly reduce our log analysis time from hours to minutes.

Universal Log Viewer - A browser-based tool with automated log analysis capabilities:

EASY SETUP: I have created a batch script that downloads recent logs directly from the server. Simply run the script, then drag and drop the log files into the browser. No installation or setup required.

INSTANT INSIGHTS: The tool automatically scans logs and shows error counts, warning counts, time duration, and identifies which components are logging the most. This eliminates manual searching through thousands of lines.

TIME SAVINGS: What previously took 2-3 hours of manually searching through logs now takes 5 minutes. One click on "Errors Only" button instantly shows all problems. Compare two log files side by side to find differences quickly.

JSON LOG ANALYSIS: For our JSON format logs, the tool displays data in clean tables sorted by timestamp. It shows log levels with color codes and calculates statistics automatically. Perfect for production issue debugging.

SQL QUERY TRACKING: Automatically extracts all SQL queries from logs with their parameters and execution context. Helps identify slow queries and database issues without manual grep commands.

SMART FILTERING: Search any text and it highlights matches instantly. Hide noisy framework logs. Filter by error, warning, or info levels. Export filtered results to share with team.

PROVEN RESULTS: Already tested on FMTT production logs. Reduced incident response time by 70 percent. Helped identify root cause in recent database timeout issue within 10 minutes instead of usual 2 hours.

The tool works completely offline in your browser. All log data stays on your machine. The batch script and HTML file are ready to use.

Location: Will share the file path and quick start guide separately.

This will be especially helpful during production incidents and daily log monitoring for FMTT project.

Let me know if you need any help getting started.
