Java Heap Structure:

Young Generation:

Eden Space: Where most new objects are allocated.
Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1): Where objects that survive a Minor GC are moved.


Old Generation: Where long-lived objects are stored.


Types of GC Pauses:
a. Minor GC (Young Generation Collection):

Occurs when the Eden space fills up.
Typically results in short Stop-the-World (STW) pauses.
Moves live objects from Eden to a Survivor space or promotes them to Old Generation.

b. Full GC (Major GC):

Collects the entire heap, including Young and Old Generations.
Results in longer STW pauses.
Occurs when the Old Generation is full or close to capacity.


GC Pause Scenarios and Application Impact:
Scenario 1: Minimal GC Pause (Optimal)

Infrequent Minor GCs with short pauses (typically milliseconds).
Application Impact: Normal response times with occasional, barely noticeable pauses.

Scenario 2: Moderate GC Pause

More frequent Minor GCs or occasional Full GCs.
Pauses last longer but are still relatively short (tens to hundreds of milliseconds).
Application Impact: Slightly increased response times. Users might notice occasional brief lags.

Scenario 3: Significant GC Pause

Frequent Minor GCs and more regular Full GCs.
Pauses last longer (hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds).
Application Impact: High response times. Users experience noticeable lags and decreased performance.

Scenario 4: Excessive GC Pause (Application Unresponsive)

Very frequent Full GCs with long pause times (several seconds or more).
Application Impact: The application becomes unresponsive as it spends more time in GC than processing user requests.


How the Application Becomes Unresponsive:

As the processedQuotes queue grows continuously:
a. Eden space fills up quickly, triggering frequent Minor GCs.
b. More objects survive Minor GCs and get promoted to the Old Generation.
c. The Old Generation fills up, triggering Full GCs.
d. Full GCs take longer as they need to process more objects.
e. If Full GCs can't free enough memory, they occur more frequently.
f. Eventually, the application spends more time in GC pauses than processing requests.


Key Points:

Minor GCs are generally quick and have minimal impact on responsiveness.
Full GCs have a more significant impact due to longer pause times.
The frequency of GCs, especially Full GCs, is crucial. Even if individual pauses are short, very frequent pauses can make the application unresponsive.
As objects accumulate in the Old Generation due to the growing processedQuotes queue, Full GCs become more frequent and take longer, leading to unresponsiveness.


Prevention Strategies:

Implement proper memory management for the processedQuotes queue (e.g., bounded queue, regular cleanup).
Optimize object lifecycle to reduce pressure on the Old Generation.
Consider using GC algorithms that minimize pause times (e.g., G1GC, ZGC) for large heaps.
Monitor and tune GC parameters based on application behavior and requirements.
