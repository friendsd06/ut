Sai, I want to thank you for being such a great teammate. You're always ready to help when we need it. You did a great job solving problems in the TPS15 project. I'm impressed by how fast you learned to handle different parts of our work. You're good at helping many clients at once. What I like most is how calm you always are, even when things get busy. You work hard and do your job really well. Thank you for all your hard work and for being such a good colleague.
