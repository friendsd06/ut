Subject: Addressing Workflow Monitoring Challenges

Dear Team,

As discussed, we've encountered difficulties in monitoring our workflows, particularly in distinguishing between retries and separate executions.

To address these challenges, I propose we explore Astronomer, a platform that enhances Apache Airflow's capabilities. Astronomer offers:

Enhanced Metrics: Provides detailed insights into each workflow run, helping us differentiate between retries and new runs.
Comprehensive Logs: Offers easy access to logs for all components, aiding in real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
Advanced Alerts: Allows us to set up notifications for issues like task failures and missed deadlines, ensuring prompt awareness.
By integrating Astronomer, we can achieve clearer monitoring, quicker issue resolution, and overall improved efficiency in our workflows.

Let's discuss this proposal in our next team meeting. Your thoughts and feedback will be valuable.

Best regards,




Current Challenges:

Monitoring multiple executions of the same DAG in Apache Airflow can be challenging, especially when distinguishing between retries and separate runs.

Proposed Solution:

Astronomer offers advanced observability features that address these challenges:

Enhanced Metrics and Analytics:

Provides detailed metrics on DAG and task runs, including counts, statuses, and execution durations, aiding in distinguishing between retries and separate DAG runs.
Displays the 90th percentile of execution times for DAG and task runs, helping identify anomalies in run durations.
Comprehensive Logging:

Allows access to logs for Airflow components such as the scheduler and triggerer directly within the Astro UI, facilitating real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
Enables viewing of detailed logs for individual tasks, providing a clear understanding of each execution's behavior.
Advanced Alerting and Notifications:

Allows configuration of notifications for task failures, retries, and SLA breaches, ensuring prompt awareness of issues.
Supports integration with platforms like Slack or PagerDuty for streamlined incident management.
Benefits:

By leveraging these features, Astronomer provides a more robust and user-friendly monitoring experience for multiple executions of the same DAG, enhancing observability and operational efficiency.



Current Challenges:

Monitoring multiple runs of the same DAG in Apache Airflow can be difficult, especially when trying to tell apart retries from separate executions.

Proposed Solution with Astronomer:

Enhanced Metrics and Analytics:

Offers detailed metrics on DAG and task runs, including counts, statuses, and execution times.
Helps distinguish between retries and different DAG runs.
Displays execution time percentiles (like the 90th percentile) to spot unusual run durations.
Comprehensive Logging:

Provides access to logs for Airflow components like the scheduler and triggerer directly in the Astro UI.
Allows you to view detailed logs for individual tasks to understand each run's behavior.
Advanced Alerting and Notifications:

Lets you set up notifications for task failures, retries, and SLA breaches.
Supports integration with tools like Slack or PagerDuty for efficient incident management.
Benefits:

By using these features, Astronomer enhances the monitoring experience for multiple executions of the same DAG, making it easier to observe and operate workflows effectively.
