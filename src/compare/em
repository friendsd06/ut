Subject: Addressing Workflow Monitoring Challenges

Dear Team,

As discussed, we've encountered difficulties in monitoring our workflows, particularly in distinguishing between retries and separate executions.

To address these challenges, I propose we explore Astronomer, a platform that enhances Apache Airflow's capabilities. Astronomer offers:

Enhanced Metrics: Provides detailed insights into each workflow run, helping us differentiate between retries and new runs.
Comprehensive Logs: Offers easy access to logs for all components, aiding in real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
Advanced Alerts: Allows us to set up notifications for issues like task failures and missed deadlines, ensuring prompt awareness.
By integrating Astronomer, we can achieve clearer monitoring, quicker issue resolution, and overall improved efficiency in our workflows.

Let's discuss this proposal in our next team meeting. Your thoughts and feedback will be valuable.

Best regards,
