Monitoring multiple executions of the same DAG run in Apache Airflow can be challenging, especially when distinguishing between retries and separate runs. Astronomer enhances this monitoring experience by offering advanced observability features:

Enhanced Metrics and Analytics:

DAG and Task Run Metrics: Astronomer's Analytics page provides detailed metrics on DAG and task runs, including counts, statuses, and execution durations. This granularity aids in distinguishing between retries and separate DAG runs.
ASTRONOMER
P90 Run Duration per Status: This metric displays the 90th percentile of execution times for DAG and task runs, helping identify anomalies in run durations.
ASTRONOMER
Comprehensive Logging:

Component Logs: Access logs for Airflow components such as the scheduler and triggerer directly within the Astro UI, facilitating real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
ASTRONOMER
Task Logs: View detailed logs for individual tasks, enabling a clear understanding of each execution's behavior.
ASTRONOMER
Advanced Alerting and Notifications:

Custom Notifications: Configure notifications for task failures, retries, and SLA breaches, ensuring prompt awareness of issues.
ASTRONOMER
Integration with External Systems: Set up alerts to integrate with platforms like Slack or PagerDuty for streamlined incident management.
ASTRONOMER
By leveraging these features, Astronomer provides a more robust and user-friendly monitoring experience for multiple executions of the same DAG, enhancing observability and operational efficiency.
