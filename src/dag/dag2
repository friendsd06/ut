This high-level architecture shows the main components and workflow:

Core Components:

DAG Execution Engine: Central component orchestrating the entire execution
Task Management: Handles task creation and execution
Execution Services: Plans and validates the execution flow


Main Workflow:

Client submits a DAG for execution
Engine creates tasks through the Task Factory
Planner determines execution sequence
Validator ensures DAG integrity
Scheduler executes tasks in the correct order


Monitoring:

Event Listeners: Handle execution events (audit, logging, notifications)
Metrics: Track execution progress and statistics



This architecture emphasizes the main data flow and responsibility separation without diving into implementation details. Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of this high-level design?
