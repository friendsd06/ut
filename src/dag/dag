I've created an architectural diagram showing the main components and their relationships in the DAG execution engine. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Core Components:

DAGExecutionEngine: The main execution component
DAGExecutionPlanner: Creates execution plans
DAGExecutionPlan: Represents the planned execution
DAGExecutionResult: Stores execution results


Task Management:

Task and SimpleTask implementations
TaskFactory for creating tasks
TaskStatus for tracking task states


Utility Components:

CycleDetector: Ensures DAG has no cycles
DependencyValidator: Validates task dependencies
ExecutionPathFinder: Determines execution paths
TopologicalSorter: Orders tasks for execution


Metrics & Statistics:

DAGProgressTracker: Monitors execution progress
DAGStatistics: Collects execution statistics
DAGStatisticsCalculator: Processes statistics
ExecutionMetrics: Stores metric data


Listeners:

Various listeners for auditing, visualization, logging, metrics, and notifications
WebSocket listener for real-time updates
