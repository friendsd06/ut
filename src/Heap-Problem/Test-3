Certainly! Let's discuss the onset of GC thrashing and long Stop-the-World (STW) pauses in the final stage of memory degradation, using a diagram to illustrate the process.

Now, let's discuss the onset of GC thrashing and long Stop-the-World (STW) pauses in detail:

Stage 1: Normal Operation

Heap usage is low, and GC occurs infrequently with short durations.
Minor GCs efficiently clear the Young Generation.
Application performance is good with minimal pauses.


Stage 2: Increasing Pressure

As more objects are allocated and survive, heap usage increases.
GC frequency increases, and durations become longer.
Minor GCs become less effective as more objects survive to the Old Generation.
Application performance is slightly affected, with occasional noticeable pauses.


Stage 3: High Memory Pressure

Heap usage is high, with a significant portion of the Old Generation filled.
GC frequency is high, with longer durations for both Minor and Full GCs.
Full GCs are triggered more often to attempt clearing the Old Generation.
Application performance is degraded, with frequent and noticeable pauses.


Stage 4: GC Thrashing (Final Stage)

Heap usage is near maximum capacity.
GC frequency is very high, with very long durations, especially for Full GCs.
Long Stop-the-World (STW) pauses occur during Full GCs.
Application becomes unresponsive due to excessive time spent in GC.



Key Points about GC Thrashing and Long STW Pauses:

Cause:

Continuous object allocation (e.g., from the growing processedQuotes queue) without adequate cleanup.
Objects promoted to Old Generation faster than they can be collected.


GC Thrashing Characteristics:

The JVM spends more time performing GC than executing application code.
Each GC cycle frees less memory, leading to more frequent GC invocations.
The application struggles to make progress between GC cycles.


Long STW Pauses:

Full GC operations pause all application threads to perform a complete heap cleanup.
As the heap size and number of live objects increase, these pauses become longer.
In the final stage, STW pauses can last several seconds, causing severe application unresponsiveness.


Impact on Application:

Response times become extremely high and unpredictable.
Throughput drops significantly as the application spends most time in GC.
Users experience long periods of unresponsiveness, making the application unusable.


Negative Feedback Loop:

Long GC pauses lead to more work accumulating (e.g., more incoming stock quotes).
This accumulated work creates more objects when GC finishes, immediately triggering another GC cycle.
The situation worsens with each cycle, eventually leading to complete application failure.


Memory Fragmentation:

Repeated GC cycles can lead to heap fragmentation, especially in the Old Generation.
Fragmentation makes it harder for the GC to find contiguous memory spaces for new allocations, exacerbating the problem.



To prevent reaching this final stage of GC thrashing and long STW pauses:

Implement proper memory management (e.g., bounded queues, regular data cleanup).
Optimize object lifecycles to reduce pressure on the Old Generation.
Consider using GC algorithms designed for large heaps and low pause times (e.g., G1GC, ZGC).
Monitor GC activity closely and set up alerts for increasing GC frequency and duration.
Implement backpressure mechanisms to control the inflow of data when the system is under stress.
