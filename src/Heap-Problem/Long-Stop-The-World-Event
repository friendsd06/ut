Color Scheme:

We use a gradient from cool blues (Day 1) to warm reds (Day 4) to visually represent the increasing severity of the situation.
The processedQuotes Queue is in a soft teal to make it stand out.
Minor GC and Full GC operations are in green and orange respectively, making them distinct from the main flow.


Structure:

The diagram maintains the day-by-day progression from top to bottom.
The processedQuotes Queue and GC Operations are separated into their own subgraphs for clarity.


Connections:

Continuous growth from the processedQuotes Queue is shown affecting each day.
GC operations are linked to their respective impacts on different stages.


Readability:

Each day's subgraph uses a consistent color, making it easy to distinguish between stages.
Text is kept in dark colors for maximum contrast against the pastel backgrounds.



Key Points for Presentation:

Explain the continuous growth of the processedQuotes Queue and its impact on memory usage over time.
Highlight how Minor GC operations are sufficient early on, but Full GC becomes necessary as memory pressure increases.
Point out the progression from normal operation (blue) to unresponsive state (red), emphasizing the correlation between heap usage, GC frequency, and application performance.
Discuss the onset of GC thrashing and long Stop-the-World (STW) pauses in the final stage.
