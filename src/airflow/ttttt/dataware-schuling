Data-Aware Scheduling with Datasets. This example will demonstrate how to set up three ingestion DAGs and an enrichment DAG that triggers only after all three ingestion DAGs have successfully completed.

Overview
Define Datasets: Represent the output of each ingestion job.
Create Ingestion DAGs: Each ingestion DAG will perform its task and produce its respective Dataset.
Create Enrichment DAG: This DAG will be scheduled based on the completion of all three ingestion Datasets.
