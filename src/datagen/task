JIRA Title:
"Design and Implement Dynamic Metadata-Driven DAG Schema for Workflow Automation"

JIRA Details:
Summary:
Create a robust metadata-driven PostgreSQL schema to support the dynamic creation of Airflow DAGs. This schema will serve as the foundational data model to store configuration, schedule, alerting, and dependency information for fully automated workflows in Airflow.

Description:
The goal of this task is to design and implement a metadata-driven database schema in PostgreSQL to enable dynamic DAG generation and customization in Airflow. The schema will support a variety of configurable elements such as pipeline templates, dataset configurations, data sources, retry policies, SLA monitoring, alerting, and pipeline dependencies.

The data model will be optimized to handle various workflow automation requirements, providing flexibility for task-specific parameters, scheduling based on business days, file monitoring, and more. Each table in the schema should store specific metadata that will be utilized by Airflow to dynamically create, schedule, and execute data pipelines.

The task involves:

Schema Design: Define tables, relationships, and metadata fields based on identified entities (e.g., Pipelines, Datasets, DataSources).
SQL Implementation: Write SQL scripts to create tables in PostgreSQL.
Documentation: Document each table and field, explaining its role in the dynamic DAG creation.
Jinja Template Integration: Outline templates for generating task configurations using Jinja.
Testing: Develop test cases to ensure data integrity and metadata retrieval performance for DAG generation.
