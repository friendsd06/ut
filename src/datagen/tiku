1. SLA Trigger Detection
Description: The process starts with detecting whether an SLA trigger has occurred.
Action: This is the initial event to start the pipeline.
Airflow Implementation: Use a TriggerDagRunOperator or Sensor to detect SLA violations.
2. Is the Trigger Manual or Automated?
Decision Point: A check is performed to determine if the trigger is manual or automated.
Outcome:
If Manual: The flow proceeds to manual substitution.
If Automated: Proceed with automated actions.
Airflow Implementation: Use a BranchPythonOperator to evaluate the condition.
3. Substitute
Description: Handles substitution logic based on the trigger type.
Outcome: Notify the Event Hub or other systems.
Airflow Implementation: Use a custom Python function or operator to implement substitution logic.
4. Did the File Satisfy Validation Checks?
Decision Point: Checks whether the incoming file passes validation.
Outcome:
If Yes: Continue processing.
If No: Block the file.
Airflow Implementation: Use a validation task implemented as a PythonOperator.
5. Allow Substitution or Not
Description: If a substitution is allowed, unblock the file; otherwise, keep it blocked.
Airflow Implementation: Implement as a decision task with a conditional branch.
6. Run Transformation, Derivation, and Validation
Description: Run complex transformations and derivations on the data and validate it.
Airflow Implementation: Use multiple transformation tasks, such as Spark or Python operators, chained together.
7. Validation Breached Threshold?
Decision Point: Determine whether the validation result exceeds a defined threshold.
Outcome:
If No: Persist to the data table and notify the Event Hub.
If Yes: Block further processing.
Airflow Implementation: Use a BranchPythonOperator to direct the flow based on thresholds.
8. Persist to Data Table
Description: Save the validated and processed data into a database or table.
Airflow Implementation: Use a DatabaseInsertOperator or a task to write data to the database.
9. Notify Event Hub
Description: Send a notification to the Event Hub or external logging system.
Airflow Implementation: Use an API call task or notification operator.
10. Primary/Secondary Feed Processing
Description: Handles the processing of primary and secondary feeds separately.
Airflow Implementation: Create separate branches in your DAG to handle primary and secondary feeds.
11. Move File to Processing Directory
Description: Files are moved to the processing directory to indicate that they are ready for further processing.
Airflow Implementation: Use a task to move files (e.g., BashOperator for file system operations).
12. Register and Get Level ID
Description: Assigns a level ID to track processing progress.
Airflow Implementation: Implement as a database task to record the level ID.
13. Wait for Activation from DMC
Description: If validation breaches a threshold, the system waits for an external activation signal.
Airflow Implementation: Use an ExternalTaskSensor to wait for the signal.
14. Allow Feed Processing or Not
Decision Point: Check whether to allow further processing of the feed.
Outcome: Either proceed with processing or stop.
Airflow Implementation: Use a decision-making task to evaluate the condition.
15. Unblock Status
Description: If the status confirms "Allow," unblock the file for further processing.
Airflow Implementation: Implement as a task that updates the file status.
Additional Notes for Airflow Design
DAG Design: Create multiple branches for manual and automated triggers, as well as primary and secondary feed handling.
Task Dependencies: Ensure tasks are properly chained and aligned with decision points.
Parallel Processing: Use Airflowâ€™s SubDagOperator or parallel tasks for handling multiple feeds simultaneously.
Error Handling: Include retry logic and failure notifications for tasks.
This step-by-step breakdown can help translate this flowchart into an Airflow DAG with proper operators and tasks. Let me know if you need detailed examples for any specific step!
