Subject: Managing Parallel Execution in Airflow DAGs

Hi [Manager's Name],

Here's a simplified explanation of managing parallel execution in Airflow, applied to our scenario:

Default Behavior Without Configuration
Scenario:
The DAG data_engineering_1 is currently running.
A user manually triggers the same DAG again.
What Happens:
By default, Airflow allows up to 16 concurrent runs (max_active_runs = 16).
This means both DAG runs will start and execute independently, with tasks potentially running in parallel (as long as task-level concurrency limits aren't exceeded).
Why This Could Be a Problem
Challenges:
Parallel execution may lead to data duplication, resource contention, or logical inconsistencies.
This is especially problematic if the DAG processes the same dataset or modifies shared resources.
Preventing Parallel Runs
Solution:
Set max_active_runs to 1 for the DAG.
Effect:
Only one instance of the DAG will run at a time.
Any additional triggers (manual or scheduled) will wait in a queue until the current run finishes.
