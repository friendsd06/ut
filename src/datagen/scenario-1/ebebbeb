Benefits of this Event-Driven, Decoupled Architecture:

Service Independence:

Each service (Order, Payment, Inventory, Notification) operates independently
Services don't know about each other's existence
Can modify/update services without affecting others


Loose Coupling:

Services communicate through events only
No direct API calls between services
Easy to add new services without changing existing ones


Scalability:

Services can scale independently
Event buffering through EventBridge
Asynchronous processing


Flexibility:

Easy to add new event consumers
Can modify event handling without changing publishers
Support for different processing patterns
