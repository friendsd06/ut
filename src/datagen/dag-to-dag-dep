There are several ways to establish DAG-to-DAG dependencies in Airflow:

TriggerDagRunOperator: Use this operator within a DAG to trigger another DAG programmatically.
ExternalTaskSensor: Wait for a task in an external DAG to reach a specific state before proceeding.
Deferrable Operators: Utilize deferrable versions of sensors to improve resource utilization.
Event-Based Triggers: Use external systems or scripts to trigger DAGs via the REST API or CLI.
Data Pipelines with Data Aware Scheduling: Coordinate DAGs based on data availability or events.
