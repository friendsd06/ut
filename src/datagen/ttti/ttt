Problem with K8s Executor for Small Python Tasks:

Overhead Issues:


Python Task (2 seconds) + Pod Startup (10-15 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Total Time: 12-17 seconds for a 2-second task


Resource Waste Cycle:

Pod creation initiated
Container image pulled
Python environment setup
Task execution (small task)
Pod termination
Resource cleanup



This is particularly inefficient for:

Quick data transformations
Simple API calls
Basic file operations
Short-running Python scripts
Lightweight ETL tasks
