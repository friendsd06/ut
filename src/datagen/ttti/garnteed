Here are the key reasons why DatabricksSubmitRunOperator doesn't provide guaranteed termination:

Architectural Limitations:

Simple Implementation: The operator uses a basic cancellation mechanism with a single API call
No State Management: Doesn't track or verify the job's state after cancellation
Limited Retry Logic: No built-in retry mechanism for failed cancellation attempts


Technical Challenges:

Asynchronous Nature: Databricks jobs run independently of Airflow
State Transitions: Jobs can be in various states when cancellation is requested
Network Issues: API calls can fail due to connectivity problems
Cluster States: The underlying cluster state affects job termination


Edge Cases:

Running Jobs: Jobs might be in a non-cancellable state
Cluster Issues: Underlying cluster problems can prevent termination
State Transitions: Jobs might change state during cancellation
Resource Cleanup: No guaranteed cleanup of cluster resources


Code Implementation Limitations:


Missing Critical Features:

No Status Verification: Doesn't check if cancellation was successful
No Force Termination: Doesn't escalate to force termination if needed
No Retry Mechanism: Doesn't retry failed cancellation attempts
No Resource Cleanup: Doesn't ensure cluster resources are released


Complex Scenarios:

Long-Running Jobs: May require multiple cancellation attempts
Stuck Jobs: May need force termination
Resource Leaks: May leave orphaned resources
State Inconsistencies: May result in unclear job status


Business Impact:

Cost Implications: Uncontrolled running jobs consume resources
Resource Availability: Stuck jobs can block resources
Monitoring Complexity: Difficult to track actual job status
Operational Overhead: Requires manual intervention



This is why organizations often need to implement custom solutions (like the GuaranteedTerminationDatabricksOperator we discussed earlier) to ensure reliable job termination and resource cleanup.

Here's how to use this advanced framework:
pythonCopy# Example usage
def monitor_callback(framework):
    # Custom monitoring logic
    print(f"Custom monitoring for job {framework.job_id}")

def termination_callback(framework):
    # Custom termination logic
    print(f"Job {framework.job_id} terminated with reason: {framework.termination_reason}")

# Configure alerts
alert_configs = {
    'email': {
        'recipients': ['admin@example.com'],
        'smtp_config': {...}
    },
    'slack': {
        'webhook_url': 'https://hooks.slack.com/...',
        'channel': '#alerts'
    }
}

# Initialize framework
job_control = AdvancedJobControlFramework(

    max_runtime_minutes=180,
    heartbeat_interval_minutes=5,
    max_retries=3,

# Start monitoring
job_control.start_monitoring()

# Update metrics periodically
job_control.update_heartbeat({

    'memory_usage': 80.0
})

# Get current status
