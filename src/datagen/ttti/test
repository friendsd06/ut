deferrable operators in Apache Airflow:

TriggerDagRunOperator - Triggers another DAG run
ExternalTaskSensor - Waits for task completion in another DAG
TimeDeltaSensor - Waits for a specified time delta
DateTimeSensor - Waits until a specific date/time
TimeSensor - Waits until specified time of day
AsyncPythonOperator - Runs Python functions asynchronously
AsyncHttpOperator - Makes asynchronous HTTP requests
SqlSensor - Monitors SQL query results
BashOperator (with defer=True) - Executes bash commands asynchronously
PythonOperator (with defer=True) - Runs Python functions with deferral
FileSensor - Monitors file existence/modifications
S3KeySensor - Watches for S3 object changes
HivePartitionSensor - Monitors Hive partition existence
Requires Airflow 2.2+ for deferrable operator support. Each operator accepts deferrable=True parameter to enable async execution.


Setting deferrable=True tells Airflow to execute the operator asynchronously, meaning:

The task can release its worker slot while waiting for completion
Worker resources become available for other tasks
Long-running tasks don't block worker threads
System can handle more concurrent tasks efficiently
