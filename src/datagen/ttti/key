Key Differences and Benefits of Deferrable Operators:

Resource Usage:

Traditional: Each sensor/trigger occupies a worker slot continuously
Deferrable: Uses async trigger service, freeing up workers


Worker Efficiency:

Traditional: Workers blocked during waiting periods
Deferrable: Workers available for actual task processing




# Traditional Sensor
sensor = ExternalTaskSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_task',
    external_dag_id='other_dag',
    external_task_id='task_to_wait_for',
    mode='reschedule'  # Still blocks a worker
)

# Deferrable Sensor
deferrable_sensor = ExternalTaskSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_task',
    external_dag_id='other_dag',
    external_task_id='task_to_wait_for',
    deferrable=True  # Async operation
)

# Deferrable Trigger
deferrable_trigger = TriggerDagRunOperator(
    task_id='trigger_dag',
    trigger_dag_id='target_dag',
    wait_for_completion=True,
    deferrable=True
)
