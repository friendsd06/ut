Key Differences and Benefits of Deferrable Operators:

Resource Usage:

Traditional: Each sensor/trigger occupies a worker slot continuously
Deferrable: Uses async trigger service, freeing up workers


Worker Efficiency:

Traditional: Workers blocked during waiting periods
Deferrable: Workers available for actual task processing




# Traditional Sensor
sensor = ExternalTaskSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_task',
    external_dag_id='other_dag',
    external_task_id='task_to_wait_for',
    mode='reschedule'  # Still blocks a worker
)

# Deferrable Sensor
deferrable_sensor = ExternalTaskSensor(
    task_id='wait_for_task',
    external_dag_id='other_dag',
    external_task_id='task_to_wait_for',
    deferrable=True  # Async operation
)

# Deferrable Trigger
deferrable_trigger = TriggerDagRunOperator(
    task_id='trigger_dag',
    trigger_dag_id='target_dag',
    wait_for_completion=True,
    deferrable=True
)

Scaling Benefits:

Reduced worker node requirements
Better handling of concurrent tasks
Lower infrastructure costs
Improved system reliability


Prerequisites for Deferrable Operators:

Airflow 2.2+
Configured trigger service
Compatible database backend
Updated DAG code to use deferrable flag

=================================================

ExternalTaskSensor Issues:

Worker Blocking: Workers get locked up running sensors
Each sensor occupies a worker slot continuously
Frequent polling creates unnecessary database load
Multiple sensors can quickly exhaust worker pool


TriggerDagRunOperator Problems:

Uncontrolled triggering can flood the system
Target DAGs may create too many concurrent tasks
Queue backlog leads to resource exhaustion
No built-in rate limiting


Resource Impact:

Database connection pool exhaustion
Worker slots getting blocked
Memory usage growing with each sensor
CPU waste on frequent polling
