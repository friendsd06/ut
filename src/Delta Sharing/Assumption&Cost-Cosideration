Assumptions and Considerations
Data Volume: 550 GB of data transferred daily.
Compute Environment: Both solutions will use AWS for compute resources.
Compute Instances: We'll select efficient AWS instance types suitable for handling the data transfer.
Time Frame: Costs will be calculated on a monthly basis (30 days).
Data Transfer Costs: We'll include AWS data transfer (egress) costs for data sent out to the internet.
Storage Costs: Assume data is stored in Amazon S3 for both scenarios.
Databricks Subscription: Already in place, so no additional subscription costs for Delta Sharing.



1. Cost Calculation for Delta Sharing
a. Compute Costs

Delta Sharing Compute Usage:

In Delta Sharing, data is stored in cloud storage (S3).
Compute costs are minimal for the data provider since the recipients incur compute costs when querying the data.
However, the provider might need a compute resource to manage sharing configurations and metadata.
Compute Instance Selection:

We'll assume a small Databricks Serverless SQL Warehouse is used to handle any necessary compute tasks.
For simplicity, let's estimate using an AWS equivalent instance type, such as m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM).
Compute Cost Estimation:

Hourly Cost of m5.large: Approximately $0.096 per hour.
Usage Duration: Since the compute resource is minimally used, we'll estimate 4 hours per day for tasks like managing shares and occasional metadata operations.
Monthly Compute Cost:
Daily Compute Cost: 4 hours/day * $0.096/hour = $0.384 per day
Monthly Compute Cost: $0.384/day * 30 days = $11.52 per month
b. Data Transfer Costs

Data Transfer Out (Egress):

AWS charges for data transferred out to the internet.
Total Monthly Data Transfer: 550 GB/day * 30 days = 16,500 GB per month
AWS Data Transfer Pricing:

First 10 TB (10,240 GB): $0.09 per GB
Next 40 TB: $0.085 per GB
Calculating Data Transfer Costs:

First 10,240 GB:
10,240 GB * $0.09/GB = $921.60
Remaining Data (16,500 GB - 10,240 GB = 6,260 GB):
6,260 GB * $0.085/GB = $532.10
Total Data Transfer Cost:
$921.60 + $532.10 = $1,453.70 per month
c. Storage Costs

Amazon S3 Storage Costs:
Assume data is stored in S3 Standard storage.
S3 Standard Storage Cost: Approximately $0.023 per GB per month.
Total Data Stored: Since 550 GB is being transferred daily, we can assume a steady state of 550 GB stored, unless data accumulates.
Monthly Storage Cost:
550 GB * $0.023/GB = $12.65 per month
d. Total Cost for Delta Sharing

Compute Cost: $11.52 per month
Data Transfer Cost: $1,453.70 per month
Storage Cost: $12.65 per month
Total Monthly Cost: $11.52 + $1,453.70 + $12.65 = $1,477.87


--------------------------------------


2. Cost Calculation for Custom Java Service
a. Compute Costs

Compute Instance Selection:

For transferring 550 GB daily, we'll need a robust EC2 instance.
Choose an m5.xlarge instance (4 vCPUs, 16 GiB RAM).
Hourly Cost of m5.xlarge: Approximately $0.192 per hour.
Compute Usage Estimation:

Assume the service runs 24/7 to handle data processing and transfers.
Monthly Compute Cost:
$0.192/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = $138.24 per month
b. Data Transfer Costs

Data Transfer Out (Egress):
Same as Delta Sharing since data volume is the same.
Total Data Transfer Cost: $1,453.70 per month
c. Storage Costs

Amazon S3 Storage Costs:
Data needs to be stored for the service to access.
Monthly Storage Cost: Same as Delta Sharing, $12.65 per month
d. Additional Costs

Development and Maintenance Costs:
Initial development cost for the Custom Java Service.
Ongoing maintenance and operational overhead.
For this comparison, we'll consider an estimated monthly maintenance cost.
Assumed Maintenance Cost: Let's estimate $500 per month for developer time and system management.
e. Total Cost for Custom Java Service

Compute Cost: $138.24 per month
Data Transfer Cost: $1,453.70 per month
Storage Cost: $12.65 per month
Maintenance Cost: $500 per month
Total Monthly Cost: $138.24 + $1,453.70 + $12.65 + $500 = $2,104.59
3. Cost Comparison
Delta Sharing Total Monthly Cost: $1,477.87
Custom Java Service Total Monthly Cost: $2,104.59
Difference: $2,104.59 - $1,477.87 = $626.72

Result: Using Delta Sharing is approximately $626.72 less expensive per month compared to a Custom Java Service for transferring 550 GB of data daily.



4. Analysis and Considerations
Delta Sharing Advantages:

Lower Compute Costs: Minimal compute resources needed on the provider's side.
Reduced Maintenance: Managed service with less operational overhead.
Scalability: Designed to handle large data volumes efficiently.
Security and Compliance: Built-in features for secure data sharing.
Custom Java Service Challenges:

Higher Compute Costs: Requires a dedicated instance running continuously.
Maintenance Overhead: Additional costs for development and ongoing maintenance.
Potential Performance Issues: Custom code may not be as optimized for large-scale data transfer.
Security Implementation: Must ensure robust security measures are in place.
