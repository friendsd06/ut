Delta Sharing

Advantages:
Ease of Implementation: Ready-to-use connectors and APIs with minimal coding required.
Built-In Security: Provides fine-grained access control and auditing capabilities.
Scalability: Designed for large-scale data sharing, handling petabyte-scale datasets efficiently.
Maintenance: Managed by Databricks, reducing operational overhead.
Compatibility: Works across multiple platforms and tools, supporting various clients like Spark and pandas.
Real-Time Data Access: Offers live access to the latest data without the need to copy or move it.
Considerations:
Cost: While there are no additional licensing fees if you're already using Databricks, compute costs apply when processing or querying data.
Less Control: Limited to the features provided by the protocol, with less control over underlying infrastructure.
Dependency on Databricks: Full features are best utilized within the Databricks ecosystem.
Custom Java Service

Advantages:

Cost Efficiency: Potentially more cost-effective in specific situations, especially when leveraging existing infrastructure and avoiding additional licensing fees.
Customization: Full control over data processing, allowing for tailored solutions to meet specific needs.
Infrastructure Control: Ability to optimize resource usage and choose cost-effective hosting environments.
Scalability Based on Actual Needs: Resources can be scaled precisely based on demand, avoiding over-provisioning.
Considerations:

Development Effort: Requires significant coding, testing, and ongoing maintenance.
Security Risks: Must implement robust security measures independently, which can be challenging and risk-prone.
Maintenance Overhead: Full responsibility for updates, bug fixes, and scaling falls on your team.
Compatibility Limitations: May be limited to platforms you develop for, requiring additional work for cross-platform support.
Recommendation

The choice between Delta Sharing and a Custom Java Service depends on your organization's specific requirements, resources, and priorities:

Choose Delta Sharing When:

You need a quick, reliable, and scalable way to share data.
Security and compliance are critical, and you prefer built-in solutions.
You want to minimize development and maintenance efforts.
Compatibility with multiple platforms and tools is essential.
You're already using Databricks and can leverage existing subscriptions.
Choose a Custom Java Service When:

You have specific customization needs not met by Delta Sharing.
Full control over data processing and infrastructure is necessary.
You're dealing with unique data formats, protocols, or compliance requirements.
You have the technical expertise and resources to develop and maintain the service efficiently.
Cost optimization is crucial, and you can leverage existing infrastructure to reduce expenses.
Final Thoughts

Carefully assess factors such as:

Cost Implications: Analyze both initial and ongoing costs, including infrastructure, development, compute, and maintenance expenses.
Scalability Needs: Consider current and future data volumes and the ability to scale accordingly.
Security and Compliance: Ensure that the chosen solution meets all regulatory requirements and provides adequate data protection.
Technical Resources: Evaluate your team's capability to develop, deploy, and maintain a custom solution versus utilizing a managed service.
Time to Market: Determine how quickly you need to implement the data sharing solution and the impact on business objectives.
