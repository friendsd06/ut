Comparison: Delta Sharing vs. Custom Java Service
Aspect	Delta Sharing	Custom Java Service	Examples
Ease of Implementation	- Ready-to-use connectors and APIs
- Minimal coding required
- Standardized protocol	- Develop data transfer logic from scratch
- More coding and testing needed	- Delta Sharing: Use existing libraries
- Custom Service: Write custom extraction code
Security	- Built-in security features
- Fine-grained access control
- Auditing capabilities	- Implement your own security measures
- Risk of vulnerabilities if not properly secured	- Delta Sharing: Managed access controls
- Custom Service: Handle authentication manually
Scalability	- Designed for large-scale sharing
- Optimized performance
- Handles petabyte-scale data	- Scalability depends on your implementation
- May face issues with large volumes	- Delta Sharing: Efficiently shares terabytes
- Custom Service: May struggle with big data
Maintenance	- Managed by Databricks
- Regular updates and support
- Less operational overhead	- Full responsibility for maintenance
- Handle updates, bugs, scaling	- Delta Sharing: Provider handles updates
- Custom Service: You update the service
Compatibility	- Works across platforms and tools
- Supports multiple clients (Spark, pandas, etc.)	- Limited to developed platforms
- Extra work for cross-platform support	- Delta Sharing: Data used by various tools
- Custom Service: May work with specific apps
Real-Time Data Access	- Live access to latest data
- No need to copy or move data	- Data may become stale
- Requires mechanisms for freshness	- Delta Sharing: Always get latest data
- Custom Service: Data may be outdated
Cost	- No extra cost with Databricks
- Pay for compute when consuming data
- Economies of scale	- Costs for development and maintenance
- Infrastructure costs add up	- Delta Sharing: Use existing setup
- Custom Service: Additional servers needed
Control & Customization	- Limited to protocol features
- Less control over infrastructure	- Full control over processing
- Customize to specific needs	- Delta Sharing: Protocol constraints
- Custom Service: Tailor processing as needed
Time to Market	- Faster deployment
- Quick onboarding for recipients	- Longer development cycles
- Slower onboarding	- Delta Sharing: Share data quickly
- Custom Service: Delays due to development
