Do You Need to Pay Extra for Delta Sharing Server?

Databricks-Hosted Delta Sharing:

Included in your Databricks subscription.
No additional cost for the sharing service itself.
You pay for compute when processing or querying data.
Self-Hosted Delta Sharing Server:

Yes, you'll incur costs for the infrastructure.
Compute Choices:
Use cloud instances (AWS, Azure, GCP) that match your performance needs.
Choose instances with high I/O throughput for better performance.
Best Option:
For most, the Databricks-managed service is the best due to ease of use and integration.
Self-hosted is ideal if you need greater control or have specific compliance requirements.
Recommendations

For Ease and Efficiency:

Use Delta Sharing with Databricks if you're already on their platform.
Benefit from integrated security, scalability, and support.
For Custom Needs:

Develop a Custom Java Service if you need specialized data handling.
Be prepared for additional costs and maintenance efforts.

Do You Need a Separate Delta Sharing Instance?

Integrated within Databricks

No Separate Instance Required: If you're using Databricks, you do not need to set up a separate Delta Sharing server or instance. Delta Sharing is fully integrated into the Databricks platform.

How It Works:

Data Providers: You can create shares directly within your Databricks workspace. This involves selecting the data you want to share and specifying who can access it.
Data Recipients: Recipients can access the shared data using their existing Databricks workspace or compatible clients that support the Delta Sharing protocol.
Using Open-Source Delta Sharing Server

When a Separate Instance is Needed:
External Sharing: If you need to share data with organizations or users who do not use Databricks, you might consider deploying the open-source Delta Sharing Server.
Custom Requirements: Organizations with specific compliance, security, or infrastructure needs may opt for a separate server.
Considerations:
Infrastructure Costs: Deploying a separate Delta Sharing Server will incur additional costs related to infrastructure and maintenance (e.g., cloud instances, storage, networking).
Management Overhead: You'll be responsible for managing the server, including updates, security patches, and scalability.
