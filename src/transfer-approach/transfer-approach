Traditional REST API Approach:

The client sends an API request to your server.
Your server executes the query on Databricks.
Databricks returns the results to your server.
Your server streams the results back to the client.

Pros: Simple to implement for small datasets.
Cons: Not efficient for large datasets, can timeout for long-running queries.
Intermediate Storage Approach:

The client sends an API request to your server.
Your server submits a job to Databricks.
Databricks executes the query and stores results in cloud storage.
Your server checks the job status and provides access to the client.
The client retrieves data directly from cloud storage.

Pros: Can handle large datasets, allows for asynchronous processing.
Cons: Requires managing storage and access control.
Delta Sharing Approach:

The client sends an API request to your server.
Your server submits a job to Databricks.
Databricks executes the query and stores results in Delta Lake format.
Databricks configures sharing through the Delta Sharing Server.
Your server requests sharing credentials and provides them to the client.
The client uses these credentials to request data directly from the Delta Sharing Server.
The Delta Sharing Server streams the data to the client.

Pros: Efficient for large datasets, provides fine-grained access control, supports incremental updates.
Cons: Requires setting up and managing Delta Sharing infrastructure.
