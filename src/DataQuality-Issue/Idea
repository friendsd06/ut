Subject: Important: Ongoing Data Problems Hurting Our Work
Dear [Manager's Name],
I'm writing about a big problem that's making our work much harder. We keep getting bad data from the Reference Data Team, and it's causing a lot of trouble.
The Problem:

The data often has duplicate entries.
Sometimes important information is missing (we call these "null values").
We can't tell if the data has actually changed since the last update.

How This Hurts Us:

Our Spark programs run slowly and might give wrong results.
We waste a lot of time fixing these problems.
We often have to redo all our work, even when nothing important has changed.
Our team is spending too much time putting out fires instead of doing useful work.

What We Think Will Help:
We want the Reference Data Team to give us a report with every data update. This report should tell us:

How many entries are in the data
How many duplicates there are
How many pieces of missing information there are
What's changed since the last update
When the last big change happened

We also want to agree on what's "okay" for duplicates and missing information. If there are too many problems, they should fix the data before sending it to us.
Why This Will Help:

We'll know about problems before they cause trouble.
We won't waste time redoing work when we don't need to.
Our programs will work better and faster.
We'll all know who's responsible for what.
We can focus on doing good work instead of always fixing problems.

What to Do Next:

Can we set up a meeting with the Reference Data Team soon?
We need to agree on what should be in the report and what level of problems is okay.
We could try this new way of working for a month and see if it helps.

This is really important because right now, we're wasting a lot of time and effort. I'm happy to talk more about this anytime.
