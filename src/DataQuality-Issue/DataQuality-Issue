Subject: Urgent: Data Quality Issues Impacting Spark Program Performance
Dear [Manager's Name],
I'm writing to bring your attention to a critical issue affecting our Spark program's performance due to data quality problems in updates received from the Reference Data Team.
Issue:
We've identified two main problems with the data updates:

Duplicate entries
Null values in critical fields

Impact:
These data quality issues are causing significant skew in our Spark programs, leading to:

Increased processing time
Potential inaccuracies in our analyses
Additional time spent by our team troubleshooting and cleaning data

Proposed Solution:
To address this ongoing issue, we suggest implementing a data quality reporting process:

Request that the Reference Data Team provide a data quality report with each update, including:

Total number of records
Number of duplicate entries
Number of null values per field
Any other relevant data quality metrics


Establish agreed-upon thresholds for acceptable levels of duplicates and null values.
If the data quality report shows metrics exceeding these thresholds, the Reference Data Team should resolve the issues before we process the update.

Benefits:

Proactive identification of data quality issues
Reduced time spent on troubleshooting by our team
Improved accuracy and efficiency of our Spark programs
Clear communication and accountability between teams

Next Steps:
I recommend scheduling a meeting with the Reference Data Team to discuss this proposal and establish a mutually beneficial process. We can work together to define the reporting format and quality thresholds.
Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you need any additional information.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
