# Reconciliation Engine Algorithm Implementation Table

| Algorithm | Purpose | Implementation Details | Considerations |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1. Schema Comparison | Identify structural differences between datasets | - Use Spark's `StructType` comparison<br>- Create sets of column names and compare<br>- Check data types for common columns | - How to handle schema evolution<br>- Decide on action for mismatches (fail or warn) |
| 2. Data Profiling | Generate statistical summary of each column | - Use Spark's `agg` function with custom aggregations<br>- Implement separate logic for numeric and categorical columns | - Optimize for large datasets<br>- Define thresholds for "normal" vs "suspicious" stats |
| 3. Exact Match Comparison | Quick assessment of dataset similarity | - Use Spark's `intersect` and `count` operations | - Consider performance impact on large datasets<br>- Make it optional for very large datasets |
| 4. Key-based Comparison | Identify specific row-level differences | - Perform full outer join on key column(s)<br>- Use `when` conditions to categorize rows<br>- Compare non-key columns for matches | - Handle composite keys<br>- Optimize join operations for performance<br>- Deal with non-unique keys |
| 5. Column-wise Distribution Comparison | Detect subtle differences in data distribution | - Use `groupBy` and `agg` to create frequency distributions<br>- Join and compare distributions<br>- Implement statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square, KS test) | - Define significance thresholds<br>- Optimize for columns with high cardinality<br>- Special handling for numeric vs categorical |
| 6. Sample Mismatch Generation | Provide examples of discrepancies for investigation | - Filter different mismatch categories<br>- Use `limit` to select samples from each category<br>- Union sample datasets | - Determine appropriate sample size<br>- Ensure representative sampling<br>- Consider stratified sampling for balanced representation |
| 7. Result Aggregation | Compile and summarize all comparison results | - Calculate overall statistics (e.g., match percentage)<br>- Aggregate column-level statistics<br>- Format results into a structured output (e.g., nested dictionary) | - Design a clear, intuitive result structure<br>- Consider various output formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)<br>- Implement result caching for large datasets |
