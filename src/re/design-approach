Reconciliation Engine Design: Step-by-Step Approach
1. User Interface Setup

Create dropdown for asset class selection (loan, deposit, commitment)
Create dropdown for source type selection (Delta Table, S3 Path)
Create dropdowns for production and pre-production source selection
Add a "Run Reconciliation" button

2. Data Source Configuration

Allow selection of predefined S3 paths or Delta table names
Validate selected sources to ensure they exist and are accessible

3. Data Loading

Load data from selected sources using appropriate Spark read methods
Handle potential errors in data loading (e.g., file not found, permission issues)

4. Schema Comparison

Compare schemas of production and pre-production datasets
Identify any mismatched or missing columns

5. Data Profiling

Calculate basic statistics for each dataset:

Total row count
Column-level statistics (null counts, distinct value counts)



6. Reconciliation Process
a. Exact Match Count

Count rows that match exactly between production and pre-production

b. Column-wise Comparison

For each column, compare:

Null counts
Distinct value counts
Min/Max values (for numeric columns)
Frequency distribution of top N values



c. Key-based Comparison (if applicable)

Allow user to specify key column(s)
Compare rows based on these keys to identify:

Matching rows
Rows only in production
Rows only in pre-production



d. Sample Mismatches

Provide a sample of mismatched rows for detailed investigation

7. Performance Optimization

Implement data partitioning for large datasets
Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
Optimize join operations for key-based comparisons

8. Result Compilation

Aggregate all comparison results
Format results for easy interpretation

9. Result Presentation

Display summary statistics (match percentages, row counts)
Show detailed breakdowns for each comparison type
Highlight significant discrepancies

10. Export Functionality

Allow export of reconciliation results to various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
Option to save detailed mismatch data for further analysis

11. Logging and Monitoring

Implement logging throughout the process for debugging and audit purposes
Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

12. Error Handling and Validation

Implement robust error handling for each step
Validate user inputs and data integrity throughout the process

13. Scalability Considerations

Design the engine to handle varying data sizes efficiently
Consider distributed processing capabilities for very large datasets

14. Security and Compliance

Ensure data access complies with organizational security policies
Implement any necessary data masking or anonymization for sensitive information

15. User Documentation

Create clear documentation for users on how to operate the reconciliation engine
Include explanations of output metrics and how to interpret results
