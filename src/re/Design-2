Detailed Reconciliation Engine Logic
1. Data Loading and Preparation
Logic:

Read data from selected sources (S3 or Delta) using Spark
Infer schema or apply a predefined schema
Perform initial data quality checks

Key Considerations:

Handle different file formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON)
Deal with schema evolution and mismatches
Optimize reading for large datasets (partitioning, predicate pushdown)

2. Schema Comparison
Logic:

Extract schema from both production and pre-production datasets
Compare column names, data types, and nullable properties
Identify missing or extra columns in either dataset

Algorithm:
pythonCopydef compare_schemas(prod_schema, preprod_schema):
    prod_cols = set(prod_schema.fields)
    preprod_cols = set(preprod_schema.fields)

    common_cols = prod_cols.intersection(preprod_cols)
    only_in_prod = prod_cols - preprod_cols
    only_in_preprod = preprod_cols - prod_cols

    mismatched_types = [
        col for col in common_cols
        if prod_schema[col.name].dataType != preprod_schema[col.name].dataType
    ]

    return common_cols, only_in_prod, only_in_preprod, mismatched_types
3. Data Profiling


 Data Profiling
Logic:

Calculate basic statistics for each column
Identify potential data quality issues

Key Metrics:

Row count
Null count and percentage
Distinct value count
Min/Max values (for numeric columns)
Top N most frequent values

Algorithm (for a single column):




----------------------

 Exact Match Comparison
Logic:

Count rows that are identical between production and pre-production

Algorithm:
pythonCopydef exact_match_count(prod_df, preprod_df):
    return prod_df.intersect(preprod_df).count()


 Key-based Comparison
Logic:

Join datasets on specified key column(s)
Identify rows present in only one dataset
Compare non-key columns for matching keys



Column-wise Comparison
Logic:

Compare statistics and distributions of each column between datasets

Key Comparisons:

Null count differences
Distinct value count differences
Distribution comparison (e.g., Chi-square test for categorical variables)
Statistical tests for numeric columns (e.g., t-test, KS test)

Algorithm (for categorical columns):

=====================================================================
Sample Mismatch Generation
Logic:

Identify a representative sample of mismatched rows
Ensure coverage of different types of mismatches

Algorithm:

def generate_sample_mismatches(compared_df, sample_size=5):
    # Sample from each category of mismatch
    only_in_prod = compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Only in Production").limit(sample_size)
    only_in_preprod = compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Only in Pre-production").limit(sample_size)
    value_mismatches = compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Matched" & array_contains(mismatch_columns, True)).limit(sample_size)

    return only_in_prod.union(only_in_preprod).union(value_mismatches)




8. Result Aggregation and Formatting
Logic:

Compile all comparison results into a structured format
Calculate summary statistics and percentages

Key Metrics:

Overall match percentage
Column-wise match percentages
Mismatch type distribution


def aggregate_results(compared_df, column_distributions):
    total_rows = compared_df.count()
    matched_rows = compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Matched").count()

    summary = {
        "total_rows": total_rows,
        "matched_rows": matched_rows,
        "match_percentage": (matched_rows / total_rows) * 100,
        "only_in_production": compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Only in Production").count(),
        "only_in_preprod": compared_df.filter(col("category") == "Only in Pre-production").count(),
        "column_mismatches": {}
    }

    for col in column_distributions:
        summary["column_mismatches"][col] = column_distributions[col].filter(col("difference") != 0).count()

    return summary


Now, let's discuss some key points about this logic:

Data Loading and Preparation:

We're using Spark to handle large datasets efficiently.
Schema inference and validation are crucial for catching issues early.
How would you like to handle schema mismatches or evolution?


Schema Comparison:

This step is vital for identifying structural differences between datasets.
Should we fail the reconciliation if there are mismatches, or proceed with a warning?


Data Profiling:

Profiling gives us a quick overview of data quality and distribution.
Are there specific metrics you'd like to focus on for your use case?


Exact Match Comparison:

This gives us a quick, high-level view of how similar the datasets are.
It's computationally expensive for large datasets. Should we make it optional?


Key-based Comparison:

This is the core of the reconciliation process.
How should we handle composite keys or cases where keys are not uniquely identifying?


Column-wise Comparison:

This helps identify subtle differences in data distribution.
For numeric columns, what threshold of difference should we consider significant?


Sample Mismatch Generation:

This helps users investigate specific examples of discrepancies.
How many samples should we provide? Should we stratify the sampling?


Result Aggregation and Formatting:

This step is crucial for making the results interpretable.
What format would be most useful for your team? (e.g., JSON, CSV, HTML report)



Some additional considerations:

Performance: How can we optimize for very large datasets? Should we implement sampling for initial quick comparisons?
Customization: How much flexibility do we need in terms of user-defined comparison logic?
Visualization: Should we integrate data visualization tools for easier interpretation of results?
Incremental Reconciliation: For frequently run reconciliations, should we implement a way to only check new or changed data?
