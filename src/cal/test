Subject: Update on Delays in Preprod Build Deployment

Hi Team,

I wanted to provide an update on why our preprod build deployments are taking longer than expected recently. We’ve noticed a few recurring issues that are impacting the process:

Julee Issues: Occasionally, builds get stuck due to problems with Julee. We’re actively monitoring this and working on solutions.

ECR Cache Configuration: We’ve identified a pattern where deployments fail when certain ECR cache-related configurations are missing. This leads to an ECR Cache Instance Creation Error, which halts the build.

Calico Pod Crashes: After encountering the ECR Cache error a few times, we’ve seen Calico pods crash. Unfortunately, the Calico pod image gets cached, and when we retry, it crashes again due to this cached image.

To resolve this, we’ve had to disable the ECR cache and retry the build multiple times, often taking 2-3 attempts to achieve a successful deployment.

We’re continuing to investigate these issues to find a more permanent solution. Thank you for your patience, and I’ll keep you updated on our progress.
