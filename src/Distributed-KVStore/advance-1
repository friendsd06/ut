This is a challenging but interesting project. Designing a distributed key-value (KV) store in Java without using an existing framework means you'll have to manage several core components yourself: data storage, network communication, replication, fault tolerance, and more.

Below, I'll describe how to design and implement a basic distributed KV store in Java. I'll provide code snippets to give you an idea of how to start.
 We'll keep it simple and focus on speed and distribution, without involving existing frameworks.


 Explanation
 Data Storage:

 We're using ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> to store key-value pairs in memory. This is thread-safe and ensures fast read/write operations.
 Networking:

 The main server listens on a specified port and uses threads to handle incoming client requests concurrently.
 Each client is handled by ClientHandler which can process PUT, GET, and DELETE commands.
 Scalability:

 To make it a true distributed KV store, you can run multiple instances of this server on different ports or machines.
 Use consistent hashing or a simple partitioning mechanism to decide which instance stores which key.
 Next Steps for Distribution
 Partitioning:

 Implement a partitioning scheme to distribute keys across different nodes.
 Use hashing (e.g., hash(key) % numberOfNodes) to determine which node should store a given key.
 Replication:

 Ensure data durability by adding a replication mechanism. Each key-value pair should be stored on multiple nodes for redundancy.
 A simple leader-follower model can be implemented to manage replication.
 Fault Tolerance:

 Nodes should have a mechanism to detect failures (e.g., heartbeat) and reassign partitions if a node goes down.
 Coordination:

 You can use a gossip protocol or your own mechanism to track available nodes and their partitions.
 This initial implementation provides a foundation for building a distributed KV store.
 You can improve it by adding the above features, benchmarking, and testing it in real distributed environments.
